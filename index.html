        <h1></h1>My Favorite Animal: Dog</h1>
        <p>Dogs are great because they will always move their tail and run to you.</p>
        <p>They lick your face when they like you</p>
        <p>They always seem to be happy and willing to make you happy too.</p>
        <p>And well... they sometimes make you laugh with their funny faces.</p>
